# Install via Debian Package

**WARN**: *This is just very small, free hosting, storage is limited at 250MB,
bandwidth is 250MB/month. So old version will be remove, you can get error
if bandwidth is out. Sorry I am just poor developer, I will try to improve
in the future. You should try Docker Installation, their hosting is better*

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/kevin_leptons/trop/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
